# Temp3113

I'm **Andrea** Edwards (@aedwardsxula).  The flyer mentions _mobile app development_ and _Oracle Cloud_ so I'll ask the guest speaker: (a) what are mobile apps and (b) what is Oracle Cloud.

I'm **Blue** Bishop (@tbishop25). My two questions for the speaker are (1) what languages/frameworks does Oracle use for mobile development and (2) how can students use Oracle Cloud. Tia is cool! - Darryl :) Bishop, St. Mary's Academy.
I found the presentation to be very informative. I was able to learn more about what Oracle Cloud offers.I learned about the different Clound Native Tools like Docker and Kubernetes. I thought it was helpful that Ram showed us video examples of certain cloud tutorials.
 
I'm **Purple** Terrell jr. (@darryl-ty). I would like to ask the speaker (a)Will students have an extended free trial period or free version of Oracle cloud to use and experiment with? (b) Are there any security testing features or applications within Oracle Cloud?

My view of the Oracle presentation last Thursday - I believe that Mr. Ram's presentation of Oracle Cloud was phenomenal, hoever, I would have loved to hear more about the different security measures they have in place to secure their customers in the cloud. That's nice Darryl!

I'm **Yellow** Yembu (@gyembu). My two questions for the speaker are (1) what is moblie app developement about and (2) how does Oracle Cloud work
